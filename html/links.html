					<a href="http://www.w3.org/" target="_blank">W3C.org</a>
					<p>The World Wide Web Consortium, known as the W3C, is an international community of standards for the World Wide Web (www or w3). It was founded by Tim Berner’s Lee in October 1994. The W3C is working to make the Web accessible to all users all over the world. W3C is organized as a member organization and is working to standardize the web. It also creates and maintains WWW standards. These W3C standards are called W3C Recommendations.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html_intro.asp" target="_blank">Html</a>
					<p>HTML ( HyperText Markup Language) is a computer language devised to allow website creation. These websites can then be viewed by anyone else connected to the Internet. It is relatively easy to learn, with the basics being accessible to most people in one sitting; and quite powerful in what it allows you to create. It is constantly undergoing revision and evolution to meet the demands and requirements of the growing Internet audience under the direction of the » W3C, the organisation charged with designing and maintaining the language.The definition of HTML is HyperText Markup Language. HyperText is the method by which you move around on the web — by clicking on special text called hyperlinks which bring you to the next page. The fact that it is hyper just means it is not linear — i.e. you can go to any place on the Internet whenever you want by clicking on links — there is no set order to do things in.Markup is what HTML tags do to the text inside them. They mark it as a certain type of text (italicised text, for example).HTML is a Language, as it has code-words and syntax like any other language.</p>

				<li>
					<a href="http://www.w3.org/Style/CSS/" target="_blank">CSS</a>
					<p>Short for Cascading Style Sheets, a new feature being added to HTML that gives both Web site developers and users more control over how pages are displayed. With CSS, designers and users can create style sheets that define how different elements, such as headers and links, appear. These style sheets can then be applied to any Web page. The term cascading derives from the fact that multiple style sheets can be applied to the same Web page. CSS was developed by the W3C.</p>

				<li>
					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/html/html5_semantic_elements.asp" target="_blank">Html semantic</a>
					<p>Semantic HTML or semantic markup is HTML that introduces meaning to the web page rather than just presentation. For example, a &lt;p&gt; tag indicates that the enclosed text is a paragraph. This is both semantic and presentational, because people know what a “paragraph” is and browsers know how to display them. In HTML4* tags like &lt;b&gt; and &lt;i&gt; are not semantic, because they define only how the text should look (bold or italic) and do not provide any meaning to the text.Other examples of semantic HTML tags include the header tags &lt;h1&gt; through &lt;h6&gt;, &lt;blockquote&gt;, &lt;code&gt;, and &lt;em&gt;. And there are lots of other semantic HTML tags.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/js/js_intro.asp" target="_blank">JavaScript</a>
					<p>JavaScript is a dynamic computer programming language. It is most commonly used as part of web browsers, whose implementations allow client-side scripts to interact with the user, control the browser, communicate asynchronously, and alter the document content that is displayed. It is also used in server-side network programming with frameworks such as Node.js, game development and the creation of desktop and mobile applications.JavaScript is classified as a prototype-based scripting language with dynamic typing and first-class functions. This mix of features makes it a multi-paradigm language, supporting object-oriented, imperative, and functional programming styles.Despite some naming, syntactic, and standard library similarities, JavaScript and Java are otherwise unrelated and have very different semantics. The syntax of JavaScript is actually derived from C, while the semantics and design are influenced by Self and Scheme programming languages. The application of JavaScript in use outside of web pages—for example, in PDF documents, site-specific browsers, and desktop widgets—is also significant. Newer and faster JavaScript virtual machines (VMs) and platforms built upon them (notably Node.js) have also increased the popularity of JavaScript for server-side web applications. On the client side, JavaScript was traditionally implemented as an interpreted language but just-in-time compilation is now performed by recent (post-2012) browsers. JavaScript was formalized in the ECMAScript language standard and is primarily used as part of a web browser (client-side JavaScript). This enables programmatic access to objects within a host environment.</p>

					<a href="http://validator.w3.org/" target="_blank">Validation</a>
					<p>The Markup Validation Service is a validator by the World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) that allows Internet users to check HTML and XHTML documents for well-formed markup. Markup validation is an important step towards ensuring the technical quality of web pages; however, is not a complete measure of web standards conformance. Though W3C validation is important for browser compatibility and site usability, it has not been confirmed what effect it has on search engine optimization.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3.org/standards/about.html" target="_blank">Web standards</a>
					<p>Web standards are the formal, non-proprietary standards and other technical specifications that define and describe aspects of the World Wide Web. In recent years, the term has been more frequently associated with the trend of endorsing a set of standardized best practices for building web sites, and a philosophy of web design and development that includes those methods.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/accessibility.php" target="_blank">Accessibility</a>
					<p>Web accessibility refers to the inclusive practice of removing barriers that prevent access to websites by people with disabilities. When sites are correctly designed, developed and edited, all users have equal access to information and functionality. For example, when a site is coded with semantically meaningful HTML, with textual equivalents provided for images and with links named meaningfully, this helps blind users using text-to-speech software and/or text-to-Braille hardware. When text and images are large and/or enlargeable, it is easier for users with poor sight to read and understand the content. When links are underlined (or otherwise differentiated) as well as colored, this ensures that color blind users will be able to notice them. When clickable links and areas are large, this helps users who cannot control a mouse with precision. When pages are coded so that users can navigate by means of the keyboard alone, or a single switch access device alone, this helps users who cannot use a mouse or even a standard keyboard. When videos are closed captioned or a sign language version is available, deaf and hard-of-hearing users can understand the video. When flashing effects are avoided or made optional, users prone to seizures caused by these effects are not put at risk. And when content is written in plain language and illustrated with instructional diagrams and animations, users with dyslexia and learning difficulties are better able to understand the content. When sites are correctly built and maintained, all of these users can be accommodated without decreasing the usability of the site for non-disabled users.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/intro/usable" target="_blank">Web usability</a>
					<p>Usability is about designing products to be effective, efficient, and satisfying. Usability is part of the human-computer interaction (HCI) research and design field (which is much broader than usability testing). For web developers, a key aspect of usability is following a user-centered design (UCD) process to create positive user experiences. User-centered design (UCD) focuses on usability goals, user characteristics, environment, tasks, and workflow in designing a user interface to meet user requirements. For example, UCD considers users' hardware, software, computer experience, task knowledge, and other characteristics in designing a website, web application, browser, and other web tool. UCD is an iterative process with well-defined methods and techniques for analysis, design, and evaluation from the first stage of projects through implementation.</p>

					<a href="http://www.w3schools.com/xml/xml_whatis.asp" target="_blank">XML</a>
					<p>Extensible Markup Language (XML) is a markup language that defines a set of rules for encoding documents in a format that is both human-readable and machine-readable. It is defined by the W3C's XML 1.0 Specification and by several other related specifications, all of which are free open standards. The design goals of XML emphasize simplicity, generality and usability across the Internet. It is a textual data format with strong support via Unicode for different human languages. Although the design of XML focuses on documents, it is widely used for the representation of arbitrary data structures such as those used in web services.Several schema systems exist to aid in the definition of XML-based languages, while many application programming interfaces (APIs) have been developed to aid the processing of XML data</p>
